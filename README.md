# Pune-Census-ward-names
It's very difficult to find an electronic copy of the 2011 Census ward names of Pune Municipal Corporation. Without the ward names, micro analysis of Census data, Economic Census data makes no sense. A digital copy of the census ward names is converted as a dataset so, ward numbers can be mapped to their names.

## Files

1. pune-ward-wise-2011.pdf : Is a PDF file that contains the ward number and names in Marathi.
2. census11-pune-ward-names.csv: Is a csv where the ward names from 1. are mapped to its ward number in an easy to use csv file.
