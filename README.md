# Pune-Census-ward-names
It's very difficult to find a CSV containing the 2011 Census ward names and its number of the Pune Municipal Corporation. Without the ward names, micro analysis of Census data abd the Economic Census data makes no sense. A digital copy of the census ward names found on PMC website is converted as a dataset which can be merged with the Census data.

## Files

1. pune-ward-wise-2011.pdf : Is a PDF file that contains the ward number and names in Marathi.
2. census11-pune-ward-names.csv: Is a csv where the ward names from 1. are mapped to its ward number in an easy to use csv file.
